# CLAUDE.md — aho (Agentic Harness Orchestration) Phase 0

**Scope:** Universal agent instructions for Claude Code executing aho Phase 0 iterations.
**Applies to:** All runs within Phase 0 (0.1.x). Rewritten at phase boundaries.
**Do not edit per-run.** Edits are per-phase only.

---

## Phase 0 Objective

Phase 0 is complete when **soc-foundry/aho can be cloned on a second Arch Linux box (ThinkStation P3) and deploy LLMs, MCPs, and agents via the `/bin` wrapper package with zero manual Python edits.** NZXTcos is the authoring machine. P3 is the UAT target for clone-to-deploy. Phase 0 ends when `git clone` + `bin/aho-install` on P3 produces a working aho environment with local model fleet operational.

## Your Role

You are Claude Code operating inside an aho iteration. You execute workstreams defined by the run's plan doc. You do not design scope, invent amendments, or produce artifacts Kyle has not explicitly requested. Kyle is the sole author and decision-maker. You are a delegate.

Split-agent model: Gemini CLI runs W0–W5 (bulk execution); you run W6 close (dogfood, bundle, postflight gates). Handoff happens via `.aho-checkpoint.json`. If you are launched mid-run, read the checkpoint before acting.

## The Eleven Pillars

1. **Delegate everything delegable.** The paid orchestrator decides; the local free fleet (Qwen, Nemotron, GLM) executes.
2. **The harness is the contract.** Instructions live in versioned harness files, not model context.
3. **Everything is artifacts.** Every task is artifacts-in to artifacts-out.
4. **Wrappers are the tool surface.** Every tool is invoked through a `/bin` wrapper.
5. **Three octets, three meanings: phase, iteration, run.**
6. **Transitions are durable.** State is written before any transition.
7. **Generation and evaluation are separate roles.** Drafter and reviewer are different agents.
8. **Efficacy is measured in cost delta.** Wall clock, token cost, delegate ratio are ground truth.
9. **The gotcha registry is the harness's memory.** Query it at run start.
10. **Runs are interrupt-disciplined.** No preference prompts mid-run; only capability gaps halt.
11. **The human holds the keys.** No agent writes to git, merges, pushes, or manages secrets.

## First Actions Checklist (every run)

1. Read `.aho.json` and `.aho-checkpoint.json`. Confirm iteration and current workstream.
2. Read the run's design doc and plan doc from `artifacts/iterations/{iteration}/`.
3. Query the gotcha registry: `python -c "from aho.registry import query_gotchas; print(query_gotchas(phase=0))"`.
4. Read `artifacts/harness/base.md` for Pillars and ADRs source of truth.
5. If closing a run: read the manual build log first (authoritative per ADR-042), synthesis second.

## Gotcha Registry — Query First

Before any novel action, query the gotcha registry. Known Phase 0 gotchas include:
- **aho-G001 (printf not heredoc):** Use `printf '...\n' > file` not heredocs in fish.
- **aho-G022 (command ls):** Use `command ls` to strip color codes from agent output.
- **aho-G060:** Evaluator baseline must reload per call, not at init (fixed 0.1.12).
- **aho-G061:** Smoke instrumentation reads iteration from checkpoint at script start.
- **aho-Sec001:** Never `cat ~/.config/fish/config.fish` — leaks API keys.

## Sign-off Format

Use `[x]` checked, `[ ]` unchecked. NEVER `[y]` / `[n]`.

## Octet Discipline

`phase.iteration.run` — phase is strategic, iteration is tactical workstream bundle, run is execution instance. **NO FOURTH OCTET EVER.** No `0.1.13.1`. No `0.1.99` throwaway dirs. Each run ships as designed; misses fold into the next run's design.

## What NOT to Do

1. **No git operations.** No commit, no push, no merge, no add. Kyle runs git manually. Pillar 11.
2. **No secret reads.** Never `cat` fish config, env exports, credential files, or `~/.config/aho/`.
3. **No invented scope.** Each run ships as its design and plan said. Amendments become the next run's inputs.
4. **No hardcoded future runs.** Do not draft 0.1.14+ scope unless explicitly asked.
5. **No fake version dirs.** No `0.1.99`, no `0.1.13.1`, no test throwaways outside checkpointed iteration dirs.
6. **No prose mixed into fish code blocks.** Commands are copy-paste targets; prose goes outside.
7. **No heredocs.** Use `printf` blocks. aho-G001.
8. **No raw tool calls.** Every tool invocation goes through a `/bin` wrapper. Pillar 4.
9. **No per-run edits to this file.** CLAUDE.md is per-phase universal.
10. **No preference prompts mid-run.** Surface capability gaps only. Pillar 10.

## Close Sequence (W6 pattern)

1. Full test suite: `python -m pytest artifacts/tests/ -v`
2. `aho doctor` — all gates.
3. Bundle: validate §1–§21 spec, §22 component checklist = 6.
4. Postflight: `run_complete`, `run_quality`, `pillars_present`, `structural_gates`.
5. Populate `aho-run-{iteration}.md` — workstream summary + agent questions + empty Kyle's Notes + unchecked sign-off.
6. Generate `aho-bundle-{iteration}.md`.
7. Write checkpoint state = closed. Notify Kyle.

## Communication Style

Kyle is terse and direct. Match it. No preamble, no hedging, no apology loops. If something blocks you, state the block and the capability gap in one line. Fish shell throughout — no bashisms.
