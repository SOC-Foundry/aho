# aho changelog

## [0.2.14] — 2026-04-13

**Theme:** Council wiring verification + cascade smoke test (Pattern C modified, claude-code drafter, gemini-cli auditor)

- In progress. 3 workstreams planned (W0 setup, W1 vet+wire+smoke, W2 close+sign-off).

## [0.2.13] — 2026-04-12

**Theme:** Dispatch-layer repair — parser honesty, model-quality gate, Pattern C trial (claude-code drafter, gemini-cli auditor)

- First iteration under Pattern C: Claude Code as primary drafter, Gemini CLI as auditor, Kyle as signer. Two-agent coordination with per-workstream audit gates.
- W1 GLM parser fix: `GLMParseError(Exception)` replaces hardcoded `{score: 8, recommendation: ship}` fallback. `_strip_markdown_fences()` handles ```json, bare ```, partial-wrap, whitespace. 3 new tests.
- W2 Nemotron classifier fix: `NemotronParseError(Exception)` and `NemotronConnectionError(Exception)` replace blanket `except Exception` and `categories[-1]` fallback returns. Specific `requests.ConnectionError`, `requests.HTTPError`, `requests.Timeout` handlers. 3 new tests.
- W2.5 model-quality gate (hard gate, rescope trigger): GLM-4.6V-Flash-9B at Q4_K_M — 4/5 inputs timed out at 180s, 1/5 returned wrong JSON schema at 105s. Nemotron-mini:4b — 8/10 inputs returned "feature" regardless of content. Parsers are honest; models cannot produce usable signal through honest parsers.
- Rescope at W2.5 (Path A): W3-W9 skipped. Fixing exception handlers around non-functional models produces correct error handling of useless responses. Carry-forwards to 0.2.14 for model viability assessment.
- Pattern C protocol documented: state machine (`in_progress → pending_audit → audit_complete → workstream_complete`), emitter table, halt conditions.
- 5 new gotchas from 0.2.12 close (G078-G083): schema v3 drift, baseline backstop, age-encrypt interaction, celebratory framing ban, exception-handler-returns-positive-value.
- Baseline stable at 13 known failures, 0 new across all 4 delivered workstreams.
- 4 workstreams delivered (W0, W1, W2, W2.5), 7 skipped per rescope, 1 close (W10).

## [0.2.12] — 2026-04-12

**Theme:** Council activation — discovery, visibility, design, measurement (gemini-cli primary executor)

- Primary executor shift: gemini-cli takes the lead for all 20 workstreams (Pillar 1/8 focus)
- Council inventory: structured audit of Qwen, GLM, Nemotron, OpenClaw, Nemoclaw, and MCP fleet (W1-W5)
- Gotcha run: G078 (schema v3 drift), G079 (baseline-as-backstop), G080 (age-encrypt interaction), G081 (celebratory framing ban), G082 (canonical path resolution), G083 (exception-handler-returns-positive-value, 35 definitive sites + 117 ambiguous)
- Strategic rescope at W5: substrate findings on model output quality prompted reassessment. Council health measured at 35.3/100.
- Visibility: `aho council status` CLI + lego office visualization foundation (W6-W9)
- Design: Workstream-level delegation pattern + dispatch contract (W10-W11)
- Pattern framework: 5 seeds authored (planner-discipline, age-fernet-keyring, install-surface, daemon-lifecycle, council-dispatch)
- Implementation: At least 3 real council dispatches measured via schema v3 efficacy
- Tech-legacy-audit: audit of shims, unused modules, and stale harness
- 20 workstreams, per-workstream review ON

## [0.2.11] — 2026-04-12

**Theme:** Verifiable acceptance framework + gate reconciliation (rescoped from 19 to 9 workstreams — executor-bias recognized mid-iteration, G077)

- AcceptanceCheck primitive: executable assertions replace prose acceptance claims (W1-W2)
- Workstream events schema v2 (acceptance_results) + v3 (agents_involved, token_count, harness_contributions, ad_hoc_forensics_minutes)
- Postflight gate reconciliation: artifacts_present, bundle_completeness, iteration_complete, pillars_present — all resolved
- Gate verbosity: run_quality and structural_gates emit per-check CheckResult detail
- 0.2.9 residual debt closed: readme_current timezone, bundle_quality §22, manifest_current self-ref exclusion
- Event log relocated to ~/.local/share/aho/events/ with 100MB rotation (keep 3); 14 downstream path updates
- §3 Trident template + pillars_present gate rewrite; canonical 11-pillar enforcement (G073 caught planner drift)
- /ws status denominator fix, workstream_start in_progress checkpoint, caption routing for document messages
- MCP readiness doc with protocol_smoke column; mcp-readiness.md in harness
- 8 new gotchas (G070-G077): stale pycache, daemon restart contract, session-locked thread, canonical drift, orphan process, hardcoded service paths, migration verification gap, planner-executor bias
- Rescoped at W9: persona 3 → 0.2.13, AUR + tech debt → 0.2.14, council activation → 0.2.12
- 9 workstreams executed (W0-W8 + W9 close), 64 new tests, per-workstream review ON throughout

## [0.2.10] — 2026-04-12

**Theme:** Install surface implementation + CLI unification + observability deployment

- Unified `aho` CLI: run, mcp, install, update, dashboard, models, openclaw, otel, bootstrap subcommands
- `_dispatch_wrapper()` bridges `aho <sub>` → `bin/aho-*` fish scripts; old wrappers kept as implementations
- `bin/aho-install` populates `~/.local/share/aho/` with harness, registries, agents, bin, secrets, runtime
- Agent instruction split: CLAUDE-iteration.md + CLAUDE-run.md, GEMINI-iteration.md + GEMINI-run.md (persona 1 vs persona 3)
- OpenClaw socket relocated from `~/.local/share/aho/` to `/run/user/$UID/openclaw.sock` (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
- OpenClaw file bridge: `run` command reads CWD files, routes to model per Q1 decision, writes output to `$CWD/aho-output/`
- `aho run "task"` end-to-end: dispatch to OpenClaw socket, persona 3 agent instructions, structured output
- otelcol-contrib v0.149.0 (direct binary, predates 0.2.10) + Jaeger v1.62.0 (direct binary) as systemd user services
- Dashboard promoted from ad-hoc to systemd user service, install completeness section in /api/state
- MANIFEST live-refresh daemon: 5s debounced regeneration on harness/registry changes
- `aho doctor --deep`: flutter doctor -v + dart --version SDK integration checks
- `aho components check`: per-kind presence verification (85/85 on NZXTcos)
- OpenClaw stability: Errno 11 retry, repetition detector (30% threshold), Errno 104 catch
- Postflight gate fixes: readme_current timezone, bundle_quality §22 flexible format, manifest_current self-referential skip
- 6 systemd user services active: openclaw, telegram, harness-watcher, otel-collector, jaeger, dashboard
- AUR install path deferred to 0.2.11 (CachyOS mirror PGP issue + Jaeger-bin AUR rename)
- 227 tests (maintained from 0.2.9), 17 workstreams, W3/W5/W9/W10 re-executed after drift verification

## [0.2.9] — 2026-04-11

- Bootstrap npm list corrected from stale 11-package to current 8-package (9th is dart SDK-bundled)
- Portability audit: 3 hardcoded paths fixed (smoke script, mcp-wiring.md, global-deployment.md), zero hardcodes remain in executable code
- `src/aho/workstream_events.py` — `emit_workstream_start()` / `emit_workstream_complete()` with idempotent guards
- CLI: `aho iteration workstream {start,complete}` subcommands
- Telegram `/ws` command family: `/ws status`, `/ws pause`, `/ws proceed`, `/ws last`

- ADR-045: Discovery iteration formalization — three-type taxonomy (remediation/feature/discovery), per-workstream review sub-mode
- Persona 3 validation: no entry point exists, chat/execute disconnected, 4/4 test tasks failed — structural gap documented
- `artifacts/iterations/0.2.9/install-surface-architecture.md` — three-persona taxonomy, aho-run dispatch spec, 4 Kyle decisions, 0.2.10 scope contract
- Updated roadmap: 0.2.10 install surface → 0.2.11 persona 3 validation → 0.2.12 persona 2 → 0.2.13 P3 clone graduation
- 227 tests (up from 182), 10 workstreams (W8.5 inserted per ADR-045 discovery pattern)
