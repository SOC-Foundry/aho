# ADR-044: Four-Phase Question-Driven Iteration Cadence

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-11
**Iteration of record:** 0.2.5 (W0 capture)
**Author:** Kyle Thompson
**Context surface:** aho methodology — the loop the human runs around the harness

---

## Context

aho documents how agents execute work inside an iteration: pillars, harness contract, gotcha registry, artifact loop, evaluator role split. What aho has not documented is the loop the *human* runs around the harness — the cadence by which Kyle drives iterations from a finished run to the next iteration's W0 contract.

This cadence emerged organically through iterations 0.1.13 → 0.2.4 and crystallized during the 0.2.3 W1 forensic close-out (where post-run verification surfaced two defects the test suite missed). It is currently undocumented, lives only in Kyle's working memory and chat context, and is at risk of being smoothed away by anyone who finds it clunky without understanding why the clunkiness is load-bearing.

This ADR captures the cadence so it can travel with the methodology when iao is published to `soc-foundry/iao` and forked to `tachtech-engineering/iao`.

## Decision

aho iterations are driven by a four-phase question-driven loop. Each phase does a kind of work the others cannot substitute for. The phases run in order, do not overlap, and do not collapse.

### Phase 1: Run produces questions, not answers

The executing agent finishes its workstreams and surfaces what it did *not* decide. The run report's "Agent Questions" section is mandatory and must be non-empty for any non-trivial iteration. The agent is forbidden from silently resolving ambiguity inside the run; ambiguity must surface as a question for Kyle.

This inverts the dominant LLM failure mode where agents decide silently and bury assumptions in output. Question-shaped outputs catch assumptions while they are still cheap to override.

### Phase 2: Bundle consumption is forensic

Kyle reads the bundle artifacts cold and checks claims against ground truth. Ground truth means: actual disk state on the executing machine, screenshots of terminal output, file listings, daemon status, test execution. Not the run report's claims about itself.

This phase is adversarial by design. The reader's job is to find the gap between what the run report *says* shipped and what *actually* shipped on disk. Past examples (0.2.3 W1, W3) demonstrate this gap is real and recurring even with green test suites.

The forensic pass cannot be performed by the same agent that executed the run. It requires a different vantage point — either a different agent, a different invocation context, or the human directly. This is the split-agent principle (Pillar 7) extended from generation/evaluation to execution/verification.

### Phase 3: Scaffolded design and plan with explicit open questions

A drafting agent (typically the planning model in chat, not the execution agent) produces a design doc and plan doc that is approximately 85% complete. The structure is fixed. The remaining ~15% is a small set (typically 3–7) of explicit, named decisions that Kyle must answer before W0 begins.

The 85% number is load-bearing:
- 100% scaffolding produces rubber-stamp behavior and missed decisions
- 50% scaffolding produces too much human synthesis and drift
- 85% scaffolding bounds Kyle's cognitive load to a small set of specific, named choices made *in the context of the design they affect*

The open questions are grouped at the end of the design doc, presented in one round trip (not iteratively asked one at a time), and answered in one round trip.

### Phase 4: W0 prompt is the contract

Kyle's answers, plus the design and plan, are consolidated into a single paste-able block that becomes the W0 input for the next iteration's executing agent. The contract is immutable for the duration of the run. The agent executes against the contract; any divergence between contract and reality becomes a question in the next iteration's Phase 1, not a mid-run reinterpretation.

This applies Pillar 6 (transitions are durable) to the human-agent boundary, not only to agent-agent handoffs.

---

## Rationale

Each phase prevents a specific failure mode the others cannot prevent:

| Phase | Prevents |
|---|---|
| 1 — Questions, not answers | Silent assumption-burial inside execution |
| 2 — Forensic consumption | False-positive run reports (claimed-vs-installed gap) |
| 3 — 85% scaffolded design | Decision fatigue, drift, rubber-stamping |
| 4 — W0 contract | Mid-run scope reinterpretation, lost context across sessions |

Collapsing any two phases into one loses one of these protections:

- Collapsing 1+2: agent grades its own work, no adversarial check
- Collapsing 2+3: design proceeds from claims rather than verified state
- Collapsing 3+4: decisions are made without the design context they affect, or decisions drift mid-execution
- Skipping 2 entirely: the failure mode that produced 0.2.3 W1 — pass on paper, broken on disk

The cadence is *deliberately* clunky. Every temptation to smooth it ("let me make a small change mid-run," "let me ask one quick question," "let me skip the bundle review this once") would collapse one of the four phases and reintroduce the failure mode it prevents.

## Relationship to existing pillars

This ADR does not introduce a new pillar. It documents the human-side companion to several existing pillars:

- **Pillar 6 (transitions are durable)** — extended from agent state transitions to human-agent contract handoffs (Phase 4)
- **Pillar 7 (generation and evaluation are separate roles)** — extended from agent role splits to execution/verification splits (Phase 2)
- **Pillar 9 (gotcha registry is the harness's memory)** — fed by Phase 2 forensic findings; aho-G065 (claimed-vs-installed) was born from a Phase 2 pass
- **Pillar 10 (interrupt-disciplined runs)** — Phase 1's mandatory question section is the structured interrupt point

---

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Decision quality is high because each phase does its specific work without contamination from the others
- The cadence is teachable — a junior engineer can be told "you are in Phase 2, your job is to find the gap between report and disk" and execute it
- The cadence is transferable across projects — the same loop drives kjtcom iterations and aho iterations identically
- Defects that bypass automated tests (like 0.2.3 W1 and W3) are caught at Phase 2 before they propagate into the next iteration's foundation

**Negative:**

- Iteration latency is higher than a smooth single-pass loop. A four-phase cycle takes more wall clock than "agent finishes and starts the next thing immediately"
- The cadence depends on a human (Kyle) being present at the boundaries between phases. It does not run unattended
- Phase 2 forensic skill is non-trivial to teach — it requires adversarial reading discipline that a fresh operator may lack

**Mitigations:**

- Phase 2 will eventually be partially automated by post-install verification gates (aho-G065 captures the principle). Until then, Phase 2 stays manual and that is acceptable
- The cadence is documented here so a successor or collaborator can learn it from artifacts rather than from Kyle's working memory
- The 85% scaffolding rule can be encoded in the design-doc template so drafting agents (Claude in chat, Qwen via the artifact loop) produce conformant outputs by default

## Phase 2 Tooling: Dashboard

The aho dashboard (`src/aho/dashboard/`, served by `bin/aho-dashboard` on port 7800) automates a significant portion of Phase 2 forensic consumption. The dashboard aggregates component status, daemon health, recent traces, MCP fleet readiness, and model fleet state into a single `/api/state` endpoint, surfacing the gap between declared and actual state that Phase 2 is designed to find.

Concrete examples from 0.2.7–0.2.8:
- MCP fleet: 12 "unknown" components visible at a glance, surfacing five iterations of declared-but-not-exercised infrastructure
- components.yaml drift: dead entries (github, google-drive, slack, fetch) visible as "unknown" status, not hiding behind a green test suite
- harness-watcher: daemon health card showed red, prompting the W8 diagnosis that found the enable-not-start bug
- Bundle generator: hollow §4 Report and missing sidecars identified during dashboard-informed Phase 2 review

The dashboard does not replace human Phase 2 review. It accelerates it by making the declared-vs-actual gap visible before the human reads the bundle. The adversarial reading discipline described in Phase 2 above still applies; the dashboard is a lens, not a verdict.

## What this ADR does NOT decide

- Whether the cadence applies to Phase 1+ iterations (multi-machine, multi-project) — likely yes but TBD when Phase 1 starts
- Whether Phase 2 should eventually be performed by a dedicated reviewer agent rather than by Kyle — open question for 0.3.x or later
- Whether the 85% number should be tightened or relaxed based on iteration size — open for empirical calibration after more iterations
