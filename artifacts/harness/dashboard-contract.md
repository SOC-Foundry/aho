# aho Dashboard Contract

**Version:** 0.2.9
**Date:** 2026-04-11
**Scope:** Heartbeat schema, health states, polling contract for localhost dashboard

---

## 1. Heartbeat Schema

Every aho daemon emits a `heartbeat` event to `traces.jsonl` at 30-second intervals:

```json
{
  "name": "heartbeat",
  "attributes": {
    "component": "<daemon-name>",
    "pid": "<process-id>",
    "uptime_seconds": 1234,
    "role": "localhost",
    "dashboard_port": 7800
  }
}
```

Heartbeat emission starts immediately on daemon `--serve` startup and continues until SIGTERM.

## 2. Component Health States

| State | Criteria | Color |
|---|---|---|
| **green** | Last heartbeat < 60s ago | Healthy, running |
| **yellow** | Last heartbeat 60–300s ago | Degraded, possible stall |
| **red** | Last heartbeat > 300s ago or missing | Down or unreachable |

## 3. Monitored Components

| Component | Service Unit | Expected Heartbeat |
|---|---|---|
| openclaw | aho-openclaw.service | Every 30s |
| nemoclaw | aho-nemoclaw.service | Every 30s |
| telegram | aho-telegram.service | Every 30s |
| harness-watcher | aho-harness-watcher.service | Every 30s |

## 4. Polling Contract

The dashboard reads `~/.local/share/aho/traces/traces.jsonl` tail (last 100 lines), groups by component name, and computes health state per component based on the most recent heartbeat timestamp.

Polling interval: 10 seconds (client-side).

## 5. Localhost Architecture

- Dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1:<dashboard_port>` (never `0.0.0.0` in Phase 0)
- NZXTcos: port 7800
- P3: port 7900
- Port range reserved: 7800–7899
- `aho_role` field in `.aho.json`: "localhost" (default) or "public_host" (Phase 1)

## 6. Cross-Clone Push Contract (Phase 1)

Deferred. In Phase 1, clones will push heartbeat summaries to aho.run for centralized monitoring. The push contract will define:
- Endpoint: `https://aho.run/api/heartbeat`
- Auth: per-clone age key signature
- Payload: component health state array
- Interval: 60 seconds
