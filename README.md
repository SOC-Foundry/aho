# aho

**Agentic Harness Orchestration — methodology and Python package for running disciplined LLM-driven engineering iterations without human supervision.**

aho treats the harness — pre-flight checks, post-flight gates, artifact templates, gotcha registry, evaluator — as the primary product, and the executing model (Claude, Gemini, Qwen) as the engine. The methodology provides a system for getting LLM agents to ship working software without supervision.

### The Eleven Pillars of AHO

1. **Delegate everything delegable.** The paid orchestrator decides; the local free fleet executes.
2. **The harness is the contract.** Agent instructions live in versioned harness files, not model context.
3. **Everything is artifacts.** Every task is artifacts-in to artifacts-out.
4. **Wrappers are the tool surface.** Every tool is invoked through a `/bin` wrapper.
5. **Three octets, three meanings: phase, iteration, run.** Strategic, tactical, and execution scope.
6. **Transitions are durable.** State is written to a durable artifact before any transition.
7. **Generation and evaluation are separate roles.** Drafter and reviewer are different agents.
8. **Efficacy is measured in cost delta.** Wall clock, token cost, and delegate ratio are ground truth.
9. **The gotcha registry is the harness's memory.** Failure modes are indexed with mitigations.
10. **Runs are interrupt-disciplined.** No preference prompts mid-run; only capability gaps halt.
11. **The human holds the keys.** No agent writes to git or manages secrets.

## What aho Does

aho provides the complete infrastructure for running bounded, sequential LLM-driven engineering iterations:

- **Artifact Loop** — Design → Plan → Build Log → Report → Bundle. Qwen 3.5:9b generates artifacts via Ollama with word count enforcement and 3-retry escalation.
- **Pre-flight / Post-flight Gates** — Environment validation before launch, quality gates after execution. Bundle quality enforced via §1–§22 spec.
- **Pipeline Scaffolding** — 10-phase universal pipeline pattern reusable by consumer projects.
- **Human Feedback Loop** — Run report with Kyle's notes → seed JSON → next iteration's design context.
- **Secrets Architecture** — age encryption + OS keyring backend, session management.
- **Gotcha Registry** — Known failure modes with mitigations, queried at iteration start (Pillar 9).
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Gemini CLI as primary executor, Qwen for artifacts, Nemotron for classification, GLM for vision.

## Iteration Roadmap

| Iteration | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (0.1.x) | Build the harness | graduated 2026-04-11 |
| 2 (0.2.x) | Ship to soc-foundry + P3 | active |
| 3 (0.3.x) | Alex demo + claw3d + polish | planned |
| Phase 1 | Multi-project, multi-machine | planned |

## Phase 0 Status

**Phase:** 0 — Clone-to-Deploy
**Charter:** artifacts/phase-charters/aho-phase-0.md

Phase 0 is complete when **soc-foundry/aho can be cloned on a second Arch Linux box (ThinkStation P3) and deploy LLMs, MCPs, and agents via the `/bin` wrapper package with zero manual Python edits.**

---

## Installation

```fish
cd ~/dev/projects/aho
pip install -e . --break-system-packages
aho doctor
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, Ollama with qwen3.5:9b, fish shell (Linux).
